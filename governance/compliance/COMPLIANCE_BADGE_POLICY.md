# AI-HPP Compliance Badge Policy

## 1. Purpose
The AI-HPP Compliance Badge indicates declared alignment with AI-HPP principles at a defined compliance level.

AI-HPP operates under a public self-declaration model.

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to any public use of AI-HPP compliance badges in repositories, websites, or product documentation.

## 3. Requirements
- Valid levels: **Core**, **Agent**, **Enterprise**.
- Each higher level includes all requirements of prior levels.
- Any system displaying a badge MUST:
  - State its compliance level publicly.
  - Publish a public compliance declaration.
  - Clearly identify scope and limitations.

## 4. Misuse and Implications
The badge MUST NOT be used:
- Without implementing required controls.
- In misleading contexts.
- To imply official AI-HPP certification.

AI-HPP is an open governance framework, not a regulatory or certification body.
