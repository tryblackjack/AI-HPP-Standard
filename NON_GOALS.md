# Non-Goals of AI-HPP

AI-HPP does NOT:

- Guarantee absence of failure
- Replace legal or regulatory compliance
- Provide centralized certification
- Cover all domain-specific risks
- Eliminate need for human oversight
- Guarantee economic outcomes

AI-HPP is a governance and architectural framework.
