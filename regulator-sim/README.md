# Public Regulator Simulation Pack

This directory contains the **public-safe** regulator simulation scaffolding used by CI.

It intentionally excludes any internal or quarantined content. The purpose of this pack is to provide stable placeholders and check targets that can be validated in clean public checkouts.
