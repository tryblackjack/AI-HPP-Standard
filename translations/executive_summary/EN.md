# Executive Summary

AI-HPP-2025 established the ethical and governance core for high-impact AI decision-making, including the principle **W_life → ∞** and mandatory human accountability.

The 2026 evolution extends this baseline from isolated model behavior to ecosystem-level governance for agentic systems, autonomous tooling, and cross-system interactions.

The current framework introduces:

- Chain-of-responsibility controls across multi-agent workflows
- Structured interpretability and evidence requirements
- Zero-trust assumptions for unverified components
- Physical-world safety safeguards for embodied and operational systems
- Multi-jurisdiction compliance alignment

AI-HPP remains implementation-neutral and institution-oriented. It does not substitute for regulators, courts, or democratic governance structures.

Its function is to provide an auditable technical baseline that organizations can apply before deployment in high-risk contexts.
