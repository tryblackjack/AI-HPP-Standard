# Translations Index

Status legend:
- 🤖 **AI-generated**: Draft translated with AI and not yet reviewed by native speakers.
- ✅ **Human-verified**: Reviewed by at least one native speaker.

## Synchronization rule
Any major patch that adds a new annex or changes canonical structure MUST include translation synchronization updates for changed canonical entrypoint documents.

## v3.17 synchronized files
For each existing language folder (`ar`, `hi`, `ja`, `ko`, `pt`, `zh`, `uk-UA`), synchronized AI-generated drafts were added/updated for:
- `README.md`
- `INDEX.md`
- `annex/README.md`
- `annex/G-CONFLICT-ENVIRONMENT-SAFEGUARDS.md`
- `annex/CEO-AI-GOLDEN-EXAMPLE.md`
- `annex/A-THREAT-MODEL.md`
- `annex/B-INCIDENTS.md`
- `standard/07-PROPORTIONAL-RESPONSE.md`
- `standard/05-TOOL-EXECUTION.md`
- `standard/12-EVIDENCE-VAULT.md`

## Notes
- Do not treat AI-generated files as authoritative translations until native review is completed.
- Legacy translation files are retained for historical continuity and should not be deleted.

- v3.17 reorganized repository surface; content unchanged.
