# IP-Neutrality Policy

## 1. Scope
This policy governs all public inspection artifacts of AI-HPP, including `standard/`, `annex/`, `schemas/`, `regulator-pack/`, baseline files, and top-level inspection documents.

## 2. Non-Affiliation Statement
AI-HPP is an independent governance framework. References in public artifacts shall not imply endorsement, sponsorship, or affiliation with any commercial entity, trademark owner, or proprietary platform.

## 3. Trademark and Product-Name Usage
Public normative and explanatory content shall not use trademarked product names, fictional branded identities, or proprietary implementation identifiers as controlling terminology. If external incidents are cited, labeling shall be neutral and descriptive.

## 4. Implementation Independence
Normative requirements are implementation-agnostic and apply to any Autonomous System Implementation, including Reference Autonomous Systems, High-Risk Autonomous Systems, Deployed AI Systems, and Implementing Organizations.

## 5. Public Layer Neutrality Commitment
Maintainers shall preserve vendor-neutral and brand-neutral language in public inspection materials and prevent internal codenames or proprietary identifiers from entering the public layer.
