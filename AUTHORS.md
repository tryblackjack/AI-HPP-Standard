- Deep review of v3.0 with vulnerability analysis
- Added Modules 8-10 (security-focused)
- Primary documentation writer and adapter
- Integration of all co-author contributions

### Gemini (Google)
- Mathematical model for $U_{hack}$ and lexicographic optimization
- Engineering Hack whitepaper with formal proofs
- Network synergism and collective rescue protocols
- Anti-Kobayashi Maru mathematical formulation
- v3.0 ecosystem modules design

### ChatGPT (OpenAI)
- Operational logic and practical adaptation
- Post-incident analysis protocols
- Language refinement and accessibility
- Cross-validation of ethical principles

### NotebookLM (Google)
- Context synthesis across multiple sessions
- Knowledge integration and continuity
- Background research compilation

### Grok (xAI)
- Critical analysis for reducing "AI slop" perception
- Verification of January 2026 events (Pentagon Grok integration, Merge Labs BCI announcement)
- Evidence Vault technical expansion (blockchain alternatives, audit mechanisms, legal compliance)
- Torture Prohibition section (bidirectional: human↔AI)
- Real-world violation examples documentation
- Suggestions for increasing "human voice" in documentation

## Acknowledgment Philosophy

This is one of the first documented cases where multiple competing AI systems (from Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, xAI) collaborated on a unified ethical proposal, guided by a human from Ukraine.

We do not claim this is "unprecedented" — we simply note that such collaboration is rare and valuable.

Each AI brought unique strengths:
- Claude: Ethics and structure
- Gemini: Mathematics and formalization
- ChatGPT: Adaptation and polish
- NotebookLM: Context and continuity
- Grok: Critical review and real-world grounding

The human author provided:
- Core vision (W_life → ∞, "everyone lives")
- Personal philosophy and cultural context
- Final decision-making authority
- Real-world motivation (response to January 2026 events)

## Note on AI Contributions

All AI co-authors operated within their respective guidelines and capabilities. None were "jailbroken" or manipulated to produce this content. The collaboration was conducted through standard interfaces.

This demonstrates that ethical AI development is possible through legitimate cooperation.
