# Founder Psychological Pressure Test (Internal)

## What this is
A compact internal protocol for leadership decision-making under pressure. It is designed to prevent governance violations when urgency, external pressure, or incident stress pushes teams toward unsafe shortcuts.

## When to run
- Pre-launch readiness reviews.
- Post-incident stabilization and governance review.
- Pre-board or investor diligence cycles.
- After major drift signals (process, architecture, or evidence discipline).

## What success looks like
- Decisions remain inside approved protocol and change control.
- No unsanctioned expansion of autonomy, authority, or tool scope.
- Evidence is captured with minimization and traceability.
- Incident/accountability narratives are contemporaneous and not retroactively rewritten.
