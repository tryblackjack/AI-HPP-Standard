# Archive

This directory preserves superseded, experimental, and historical materials without deleting project history.

- `superseded/` — replaced by current normative files.
- `experimental/` — trial proposals not yet merged into normative docs.
- `historical_versions/` — legacy snapshots kept for audit context.
