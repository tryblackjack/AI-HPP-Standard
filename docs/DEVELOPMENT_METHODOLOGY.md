# Development Methodology

AI-HPP was developed using a structured multi-model orchestration process involving six independent AI systems and human oversight.

The development process included:

- Cross-model comparison
- Structured disagreement analysis
- Iterative synthesis
- Human-in-the-loop validation
- Final editorial accountability by a human maintainer

This methodology reflects the governance principles embedded in the standard:

- Multi-agent reasoning does not replace authorization.
- Structured disagreement increases robustness.
- Final responsibility remains human.

AI-HPP therefore serves both as:
- A governance architecture, and
- A case study in responsible human-AI collaboration.

No individual AI system is listed as an author.
Final authorship and accountability remain human.
