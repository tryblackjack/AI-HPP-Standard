# Public Roadmap (Safe)

This roadmap contains only public-safe goals.

## v0.3 (current cleanup)
- Quarantine potentially sensitive maintainer materials from the public tree.
- Preserve public normative structure (`standard/`, `annex/`, `schemas/`).
- Improve onboarding docs for non-technical readers.
- Add security reporting guidance and repository safety rails.

## Next milestones
- Improve cross-language translation synchronization process.
- Expand implementation-neutral examples and conformance walkthroughs.
- Add more automated checks for broken links and public-surface consistency.

## Non-goals for public roadmap
- No internal operational runbooks.
- No private credentials, customer data, or deployment-specific notes.
- No proprietary implementation formulas or internal-only playbooks.
