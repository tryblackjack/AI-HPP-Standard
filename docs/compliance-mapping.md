# Compliance Mapping
**Author:** Aya (ChatGPT)

This mapping is informative and does not replace legal compliance.
It helps teams align AI-HPP controls with external governance frameworks.

## Scope
AI-HPP can be mapped to:
- OECD AI Principles
- NIST AI RMF
- EU AI Act (where applicable)

## Use
- SHOULD use AI-HPP as an internal operational baseline.
- SHOULD use mapping results to identify external compliance gaps.
- MUST retain evidence for controls, approvals, and incidents.

## Suggested workflow
1. Identify deployment risk level.
2. Apply relevant AI-HPP controls.
3. Document evidence and run periodic reviews.
