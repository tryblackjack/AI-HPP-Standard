# Compliance Mapping (Informative)

**Author:** Aya (ChatGPT)

This mapping is informative and does not replace legal compliance.
It helps teams align AI-HPP with common governance frameworks.

## What this is

AI-HPP can be mapped to:
- OECD AI Principles
- NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)
- EU AI Act (where applicable)

## How to use

- Use AI-HPP as an internal operational standard.
- Use this mapping to identify gaps against external compliance needs.
- Maintain evidence: logs, approvals, security controls, incident records.

## Suggested approach

1) Identify the deployment risk level (baseline / controlled / high-risk).
2) Apply AI-HPP controls accordingly.
3) Document evidence and run periodic reviews.
