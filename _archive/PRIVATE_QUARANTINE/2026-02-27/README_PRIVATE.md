# PRIVATE QUARANTINE (TEMPORARY)

This directory is a **temporary quarantine area** for content that may contain private, sensitive, or non-public operational material.

- Source moved during public v0.3 cleanup: `internal/` (entire tree)
- Move date: 2026-02-27
- Intended audience: repository maintainer/operators only

## Required follow-up
1. Extract this quarantine folder to a secure local/private location.
2. Remove `/_archive/PRIVATE_QUARANTINE/2026-02-27/` from the public repository before release publication.
3. Purge repository history for previously published sensitive files (move alone does **not** remove history).
4. Rotate any exposed credentials/secrets as a precaution.

See `docs/POST_MERGE_OPERATOR_CHECKLIST.md` for the full post-merge runbook.
