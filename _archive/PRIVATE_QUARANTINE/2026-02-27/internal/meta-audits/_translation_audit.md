# Translation Governance Audit

## 1) version_sync status
- `version_sync` metadata aligns with v3.14 synchronization entries.

## 2) review_status consistency
- review_status entries are consistent with declared legend categories.

## 3) Draft notices on modified files since v3.14 (governance heuristic)
- Translation index marks synced language rows as AI-generated/Mixed, satisfying draft-governance signaling at index level.

## 4) Translation files without corresponding English source

- `translations/ar/AI-HPP-Standard.md`
- `translations/pt/AI-HPP-Standard.md`
- `translations/hi/AI-HPP-Standard.md`
