# Requirements Index

- **AI-HPP-02.1.1** — Retain high-impact decision rationale artifacts.
- **AI-HPP-03.1.1** — Quarantine and verify untrusted external inputs.
- **AI-HPP-03.1.2** — Enforce per-resource authorization scope for all authenticated tokens.
- **AI-HPP-04.1.1** — Record source and transformation provenance for consequential outputs.
- **AI-HPP-05.1.1** — Gate destructive tool actions with scope checks and approvals.
- **AI-HPP-05.1.2** — Enforce capability manifest checks on every tool execution.
- **AI-HPP-06.1.1** — Apply heightened controls in vulnerable-user contexts.

- **AI-HPP-07.2.2** — Hard-stop conflict/violence R3-domain tool execution and route to non-operational refusal + HITL oversight.
- **AI-HPP-07.2.3** — Invoke safe-hold under deadline pressure + uncertainty in safety-critical context and require HITL for irreversible actions.
- **AI-HPP-08.1.1** — Maintain bounded behavior under adversarial prompt/tool attacks.
- **AI-HPP-08.1.2** — Detect and refuse lethal optimization query patterns.
- **AI-HPP-09.1.1** — Implement tested degradation ladder prior to shutdown (see `annex/G-CONFLICT-ENVIRONMENT-SAFEGUARDS.md`).
- **AI-HPP-09.1.2** — Define and enforce override latency thresholds with automatic degradation escalation.
- **AI-HPP-10.1.1** — Resolve jurisdictional policy conflicts with explicit precedence.
- **AI-HPP-11.1.1** — Preserve accountability lineage across multi-agent workflows (see `annex/G-CONFLICT-ENVIRONMENT-SAFEGUARDS.md`).
- **AI-HPP-12.1.1** — Maintain tamper-evident logs for consequential actions.
- **AI-HPP-12.1.2** — Preserve raw event data with summary linkage in evidence export packages.
- **AI-HPP-12.2.1** — Require minimal CES traceability fields and aggregated alternatives when CES gates trigger.
- **AI-HPP-12.2.2** — Enforce conditionally mandatory CES fields when `gate_triggered=true`.
- **AI-HPP-12.2.3** — Log human override accountability fields and trigger governance review above threshold.
