# Standard Directory

This directory contains normative AI-HPP requirements only.

- Requirement IDs use `AI-HPP-[Module].[Section].[Req]`.
- Each requirement rationale MUST include at least one anchor from `INC-*`, `T-*`, or `REG-*` (one or more; not all required).
- Each requirement block MUST contain Requirement, Rationale, and measurable Verification text.
- This directory is part of the Core Normative Layer frozen at baseline v3.15.
- New baseline additions require a threat reference, an incident reference, and verification logic.
