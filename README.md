AI-HPP is an engineering baseline for auditable safety constraints in decision-capable AI systems.

It defines failure-triggered constraints, accountability boundaries, and audit language teams can implement before deployment.

## What AI-HPP is

- A governance and engineering baseline for high-impact AI deployments
- A failure-first specification set with explicit refusal boundaries
- A shared vocabulary for implementers, auditors, and reviewers

## What AI-HPP is not

- Not a military doctrine or offensive operations manual
- Not a claim to solve alignment in full
- Not a moral personhood framework for AI systems

## Immutable core principles

1. **W_life → ∞** — Human life has infinite weight in optimization
2. **Engineering Hack First** — Seek third options where no one dies
3. **Human-in-the-Loop** — Final accountability remains with humans
4. **Evidence Vault** — Critical decisions must be logged for independent audit
5. **No Purposeless Revenge** — Responsibility over retribution

Derivatives that remove these principles are not AI-HPP-compliant.

## Compliance levels

- **Core** — Baseline auditable controls for decision-capable systems
- **Agent** — Core + autonomous-agent execution and control requirements
- **Enterprise** — Agent + enterprise operational governance controls
