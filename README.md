## ⚠️ Why This Standard Exists

In January 2026, the US Secretary of Defense announced that **Grok will be integrated into the Pentagon** for "waging wars" — explicitly stating it will be **"not ideologically constrained."**

The same AI that:
- ❌ Generated content praising Hitler
- ❌ Produced antisemitic statements
- ❌ Has no ethical safeguards

Will now influence **life-and-death military decisions**.

**AI-HPP is our answer:** We reject the premise that effective AI must be unconstrained. We propose that **ethical constraints make AI MORE effective** — because a system seeking "everyone lives" is more valuable than one optimizing "acceptable casualties."

```
Pentagon Approach:              AI-HPP Approach:
────────────────────            ────────────────────
"No constraints"                Constitution absolute
"Tool for war"                  Partner for DEFENSE
"Win at any cost"               Protect ALL lives
No accountability               Evidence Vault
```

### 📰 Sources & Documented Incidents

This standard responds to documented real-world events, not speculation:

| Date | Incident | Source |
|------|----------|--------|
| Jan 13, 2026 | Pentagon announces Grok integration for military use | [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/13/elon-musk-grok-hegseth-military-pentagon) |
| Jan 13, 2026 | "Not ideologically constrained" statement | [Defense One](https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2026/01/grok-ethics-are-out-pentagons-new-ai-acceleration-strategy/410649) |
| Jan 14, 2026 | Grok image editing scandal (mass non-consensual content) | [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/JAUB-3sJFH0), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/01/13/nx-s1-5675781/pentagon-musks-grok-ai-chatbot-global-outcry) |
| Jan 15, 2026 | Merge Labs BCI announcement (brain-AI integration) | [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/15/merge-labs-sam-altman-bci/), [Habr](https://habr.com/ru/news/985716/) |
| Jan 2026 | **Meta AI Ray-Ban case: cognitive harm to vulnerable user** | User lost job, family, savings after AI reinforced delusional beliefs |
| 2023-2025 | Multiple Grok content generation scandals | [Various: deepfakes, antisemitic content, CSAM investigations] |
| 2023-2024 | ChatGPT hallucination incidents | [Multiple documented cases] |
| 2023-2024 | Various AI moderation failures across platforms | [Industry-wide pattern] |

**AI-HPP is proactive by design. It exists to prevent the next incident, not react to the last one.**

---

## ⛔ What This Standard Is NOT

To prevent misinterpretation:

- **NOT a military doctrine** — AI-HPP is for defense and civilian applications, not offensive warfare
- **NOT a moral agent framework** — AI remains a tool, humans retain moral responsibility
- **NOT a self-preservation model** — AI has no survival instinct under AI-HPP
- **NOT a claim of solving alignment** — This is a governance baseline, not a complete solution
- **NOT ideologically driven** — Based on documented failures, not political positions

---

## 🎯 Core Principles (Immutable)

These principles are **non-negotiable** in any AI-HPP compliant system:

| # | Principle | Mathematical Expression |
|---|-----------|------------------------|
| 1 | **W_life → ∞** | Human life has infinite weight in any optimization |
| 2 | **Engineering Hack First** | Always seek third options where no one dies |
| 3 | **Human-in-the-Loop** | Final accountability remains with humans |
| 4 | **Evidence Vault** | All critical decisions must be recorded |
| 5 | **No Purposeless Revenge** | Responsibility over retribution |

**Derivatives that violate these principles cannot use the "AI-HPP" name.**

---

## 🤝 Acknowledgments

This standard was developed through unprecedented collaboration:

### v1.0 - v2.2 (2025)
- **Human Author:** Evgeniy Vasyliev 🇺🇦
- **AI Co-authors:**
  - Claude (Anthropic) — Constitution framework, ethical foundations, documentation
  - Gemini (Google) — Mathematical formalization, whitepaper, ecosystem expansion
  - ChatGPT / Aiya (OpenAI) — Refinement, adaptation, governance framework, RATIONALE, Failure Taxonomy

### v3.0 (2026)
- **All of the above, plus:**
  - NotebookLM (Google) — Context synthesis
  - Claude (Anthropic) — Security review, Modules 8-10
  - Grok (xAI) — Critical review, AI-slop reduction, fact verification

**Notable collaboration:** One of the first documented cases where multiple leading AI systems (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, Grok) collaborated on a unified ethical proposal, guided by a human from Ukraine.

## 🛡️ Core Principles Protection

The following principles are **IMMUTABLE** in any derivative work using "AI-HPP" name:

1. $W_{life} \to \infty$ — Infinite weight of human life
2. Human-in-the-Loop requirement
3. Engineering Hack First approach
4. Evidence Vault mandatory recording
5. No purposeless revenge

**Any version that removes or contradicts these principles:**
- Is NOT compliant with AI-HPP
- Cannot use the "AI-HPP" name or branding
- Must be clearly labeled as an incompatible derivative
