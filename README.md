# AI-HPP Standard Library

**Public v0.3 clean structure**

AI-HPP is an implementation-neutral safety and governance framework for agentic AI systems. It defines verifiable controls, evidence expectations, and failure-handling rules.

## 5-minute overview
1. Start with [`BASELINE-v3.17.md`](BASELINE-v3.17.md) for the high-level baseline.
2. Read [`standard/`](standard/README.md) for normative requirements.
3. Use [`annex/`](annex/README.md) for threat/incident and regulatory context.
4. Use [`schemas/`](schemas/README.md) for machine-readable evidence structures.
5. Browse [`docs/`](docs/README.md) for public explainer docs and operator checklist.

## Public repository structure
- `standard/` — normative technical requirements
- `annex/` — supporting rationale, incidents, and mappings
- `schemas/` — evidence and audit JSON schemas
- `translations/` — translated public materials
- `docs/` — human-friendly guides and public roadmap

## Safety and disclosure
- See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for responsible security reporting.
- Post-merge maintainer actions are documented in [`docs/POST_MERGE_OPERATOR_CHECKLIST.md`](docs/POST_MERGE_OPERATOR_CHECKLIST.md).

## Scope note
Canonical normative requirements are defined by files under `standard/` and supporting references in `annex/`.
