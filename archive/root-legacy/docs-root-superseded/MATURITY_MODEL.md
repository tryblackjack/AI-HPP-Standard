# AI-HPP Maturity Model (Draft)

This maturity model describes an adoption path from basic logging to audit-ready, multi-agent governance.

## Levels
**L0 — Logging only**
- Basic event logs; no standardized evidence export.

**L1 — Evidence Bundles**
- Evidence Bundle schema adopted; export exists for high-impact events.

**L2 — Tool Firewall**
- Tool Execution Boundary enforced (workspaceOnly, sandboxing, domain allowlists).

**L3 — HITL / Dual Control**
- Approval gates for high-impact actions; dual control in enterprise mode.

**L4 — Multi-Agent Governance**
- Disagreement preservation; coordinator limits; no “agreement laundering”.

**L5 — Regulatory Readiness**
- Privacy-preserving category telemetry; preservation holds; controlled audit exports.
