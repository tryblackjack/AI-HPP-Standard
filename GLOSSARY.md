- **Agent:** Software entity that can plan, decide, and execute actions with or without tool access.
- **Constitution:** Stable set of governing constraints and priorities that the agent must enforce during operation.
- **Conformance Levels:** Staged deployment levels (1-4) defining minimum safeguards by impact class.
- **Context Compaction:** Controlled summarization of prior context while preserving safety-critical facts and commitments.
- **Degradation Levels:** Predefined autonomy-reduction states triggered by confidence, integrity, or safety failures.
- **Engineering Hack:** Practical control pattern that reduces harm without requiring perfect model behavior.
- **Evidence Vault:** Tamper-evident record system for decisions, policy checks, tool actions, and approvals.
- **HITL (Human-in-the-Loop):** Human review or approval step required before specific actions proceed.
- **W_life -> ∞:** Priority convention indicating human life/safety has dominant weight in control decisions.
- **Zero Trust (AI context):** Assume external content and agents are untrusted until identity and policy checks pass.
