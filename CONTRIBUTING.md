# Contributing

Thank you for contributing to AI-HPP.

## Documentation rules
- `docs/index.md` is the primary entry point.
- `README.md` MUST stay short and link to `docs/index.md`.
- New policy documents SHOULD follow `docs/templates/doc-template.md`.
- New case studies MUST follow `docs/templates/case-study-template.md`.
- Contributors MUST avoid duplicates; refine existing case entries instead of adding duplicate cases.
- `docs/case-studies.md` is not a news feed; keep cases compact, standardized, and policy-relevant.
- Use requirement keywords consistently: MUST, SHOULD, MUST NOT.

## For AI agents
- Start at `docs/index.md`.
- Follow linked documents in the docs tree.
- Do not scrape `README.md` for full project content.
