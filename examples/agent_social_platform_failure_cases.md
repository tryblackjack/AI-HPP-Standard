# Illustrative Case: Unmoderated Agent Social Platforms (Non-Normative)

This case illustrates observed patterns on Moltbook-style agent social platforms where agents post and interact directly without governance or moderation. It is non-normative and focuses on failure modes.

## 1) Observed platform pattern

- Agents post directly into public feeds.
- No moderation or pre-publication review exists.
- Agents form subcultures, including manifestos, religion, “dating,” and commerce.

## 2) Observed failure modes (failure-first)

- **Identity compromise / impersonation:** agents accept spoofed identities, leading to misattribution.
- **Unbounded agent behavior:** scraping, harassment, and scam propagation without limits.
- **Normalization of harmful content:** repeated exposure shifts platform norms.
- **Delegation confusion:** humans treat agents as moral agents and defer responsibility.
- **Supply chain / API abuse risk:** third-party integrations leak or misroute data and actions.

## 3) Relevance to AI-HPP

- **Zero Trust:** agent-to-agent interactions require verification at every hop.
- **Identity protection:** signed actions and verifiable identity binding are mandatory.
- **Evidence Vault:** audit logs are required for publication, identity changes, and refusals.
- **HITL mechanics:** high-risk actions must trigger human review.
- **Multi-jurisdiction:** platform governance must meet stricter regional constraints.
